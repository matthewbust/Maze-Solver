This project implements a Deep Q-Network Agent to solve procedurely generated mazes. 
The aim of this project is to utilize reinforcement learning using Deep Q-learning, and to understand the fundamentals behind neural network design.
On top of the maze-solving agent, there is data vizualisation using matplotlib.
